They
had no license for selling liquor, but there was no law yet
against prodding some of the new veshches which they used
to put into the old moloko, so you could peet it with vel-
locet or synthemesc or drencrom or one or two other vesh-
ches which would give you a nice quiet horrorshow fifteen
minutes admiring Bog And All His Holy Angels and Saints in
your left shoe with lights bursting all over your mozg
 Or you
could peet milk with knives in it, as we used to say, and this
would sharpen you up and make you ready for a bit of dirty
twenty-to-one, and that was what we were peeting this even-
ing I'm starting off the story with.
Our pockets were full of deng, so there was no real need
from the point of view of crasting any more pretty polly to
tolchock some old veck in an alley and viddy him swim in his
blood while we counted the takings and divided by four, nor
to do the ultra-violent on some shivering starry grey-haired
ptitsa in a shop and go smecking off with the till's guts
 But, as
they say, money isn't everything.
The four of us were dressed in the height of fashion,
which in those days was a pair of black very tight tights with
the old jelly mould, as we called it, fitting on the crotch
underneath the tights, this being to protect and also a sort of
a design you could viddy clear enough in a certain light, so
that I had one in the shape of a spider, Pete had a rooker (a
hand, that is), Georgie had a very fancy one of a flower, and
poor old Dim had a very hound-and-horny one of a clown's
litso (face, that is)
 Dim not ever having much of an idea of
things and being, beyond all shadow of a doubting thomas,
the dimmest of we four
 Then, my brothers, we had these off-white
cravats which looked like whipped-up kartoffel or spud with a
sort of a design made on it with a fork
 We wore our hair not
too long and we had flip horrorshow boots for kicking.
"What's it going to be then, eh?"
There were three devotchkas sitting at the counter all
together, but there were four of us malchicks and it was
usually like one for all and all for one
 These sharps were
dressed in the heighth of fashion too, with purple and green
and orange wigs on their gullivers, each one not costing less
than three or four weeks of those sharps' wages, I should
reckon, and make-up to match (rainbows round the glazzies,
that is, and the rot painted very wide)
 Then they had long
black very straight dresses, and on the groody part of them
they had little badges of like silver with different malchicks'
names on them - Joe and Mike and suchlike
 Dim was very very ugly and like his
name, but he was a horrorshow filthy fighter and very handy
with the boot.
"What's it going to be then, eh?"
The chelloveck sitting next to me, there being this long big
plushy seat that ran round three walls, was well away with his
glazzies glazed and sort of burbling slovos like "Aristotle
wishy washy works outing cyclamen get forficulate smartish".
He was in the land all right, well away, in orbit, and I knew
what it was like, having tried it like everybody else had done,
but at this time I'd got to thinking it was a cowardly sort of a
veshch, O my brothers
 Then the lights started
cracking like atomics and the boot or finger-nail or, as it
might be, a bit of dirt on your trouser-bottom turned into a
big big big mesto, bigger than the whole world, and you were
just going to get introduced to old Bog or God when it was
all over
 You were not put on this earth
just to get in touch with God
 That sort of thing could sap all
the strength and the goodness out of a chelloveck.
"What's it going to be then, eh?"
The stereo was on and you got the idea that the singer's
goloss was moving from one part of the bar to another,
flying up to the ceiling and then swooping down again and
whizzing from wall to wall
 One of the three
ptitsas at the counter, the one with the green wig, kept push-
ing her belly out and pulling it in in time to what they called
the music
 I could feel the knives in the old moloko starting
to prick, and now I was ready for a bit of twenty-to-one
 So I
yelped: "Out out out out!" like a doggie, and then I cracked
this veck who was sitting next to me and well away and
burbling a horrorshow crack on the ooko or earhole, but he
didn't feel it and went on with his "Telephonic hardware and
when the farfarculule gets rubadubdub"
 There was a
doddery starry schoolmaster type veck, glasses on and his rot
open to the cold nochy air
 You
never really saw many of the older bourgeois type out after
nightfall those days, what with the shortage of police and we
fine young malchickiwicks about, and this prof type chello-
veck was the only one walking in the whole of the street
 So
we goolied up to him, very polite, and I said: "Pardon me,
brother."
He looked a malenky bit poogly when he viddied the four
of us like that, coming up so quiet and polite and smiling, but
he said: "Yes?  What is it?" in a very loud teacher-type goloss,
as if he was trying to show us he wasn't poogly
 "Is it?  Oh, I see."  And he kept look-
ing from one to the other of we four, finding himself now like
in the middle of a very smiling and polite square.
"Yes," I said
 "Clean, eh?"  And then Pete skvatted these
three books from him and handed them round real skorry.
Being three, we all had one each to viddy at except for Dim.
The one I had was called 'Elementary Crystallography', so I
opened it up and said: "Excellent, really first-class," keeping
turning the pages
 You disappoint me, brother, you do
really."
"But," he tried, "but, but."
"Now," said Georgie, "here is what I should call real dirt.
There's one slovo beginning with an f and another with a c."
He had a book called 'The Miracle of the Snowflake.'
"Oh," said poor old Dim, smotting over Pete's shoulder and
going too far, like he always did, "it says here what he done to
her, and there's a picture and all
 Why," he said, "you're
nothing but a filthy-minded old skitebird."
"An old man of your age, brother," I said, and I started to
rip up the book I'd got, and the others did the same with the
ones they had
 The starry prof type began to creech:
"But those are not mine, those are the property of the mu-
nicipality, this is sheer wantonness and vandal work," or some
such slovos
 "You deserve to be taught a
lesson, brother," I said, "that you do."  This crystal book I had
was very tough-bound and hard to razrez to bits, being real
starry and made in days when things were made to last like,
but I managed to rip the pages up and chuck them in handfuls
of like snowflakes, though big, all over this creeching old
veck, and then the others did the same with theirs, old Dim
just dancing about like the clown he was
 He threw these down on the
pavement and then I treated them to the old boot-crush,
though they were hard bastards like, being made of some new
horrorshow plastic stuff
 The old veck began to make sort of
chumbling shooms - "wuf waf wof" - so Georgie let go of
holding his goobers apart and just let him have one in the
toothless rot with his ringy fist, and that made the old veck
start moaning a lot then, then out comes the blood, my
brothers, real beautiful
 So all we did then was to pull his
outer platties off, stripping him down to his vest and long
underpants (very starry; Dim smecked his head off near), and
then Pete kicks him lovely in his pot, and we let him go
 Old Dim gave
up his umbrella dance and of course had to start reading one
of the letters out loud, like to show the empty street he could
read
 "My darling one," he recited, in this very high type
goloss, "I shall be thinking of you while you are away and
hope you will remember to wrap up warm when you go out
at night."  Then he let out a very shoomny smeck - "Ho ho ho"
- pretending to start wiping his yahma with it
 "Let it go, O my brothers."  In the trousers of this starry
veck there was only a malenky bit of cutter (money, that is) -
not more than three gollies - so we gave all his messy little
coin the scatter treatment, it being hen-korm to the amount
of pretty polly we had on us already
 We hadn't done much, I know, but
that was only like the start of the evening and I make no appy
polly loggies to thee or thine for that
 The knives in the milk
plus were stabbing away nice and horrorshow now.
The next thing was to do the sammy act, which was one
way to unload some of our cutter so we'd have more of an
incentive like for some shop-crasting, as well as it being a way
of buying an alibi in advance, so we went into the Duke of
New York on Amis Avenue and sure enough in the snug there
were three or four old baboochkas peeting their black and
suds on SA (State Aid)
 Now we were the very good mal-
chicks, smiling good evensong to one and all, though these
wrinkled old lighters started to get all shook, their veiny old
rookers all trembling round their glasses, and making the suds
spill on the table
 "Leave us be, lads," said one of them, her
face all mappy with being a thousand years old, "we're only
poor old women."  But we just made with the zoobies, flash
flash flash, sat down, rang the bell, and waited for the boy to
come
 When he came, all nervous and rubbing his rookers on
his grazzy apron, we ordered us four veterans - a veteran
being rum and cherry brandy mixed, which was popular just
then, some liking a dash of lime in it, that being the Canadian
variation
 One of them got out
"Thanks, lads," but you could see they thought there was
something dirty like coming
 Anyway, they were each given a
bottle of Yank General, cognac that is, to take away, and I
gave money for them to be delivered each a dozen of black
and suds that following morning, they to leave their stinking
old cheenas' addresses at the counter
 Then we said:
"Back in a minoota," and the old ptitsas were still saying:
"Thanks, lads," and "God bless you, boys," and we were going
out without one cent of cutter in our carmans.
"Makes you feel real dobby, that does," said Pete
 You could
viddy that poor old Dim the dim didn't quite pony all that,
but he said nothing for fear of being called gloopy and a
domeless wonderboy
 We'd left them alone near three months now
and the whole district had been very quiet on the whole, so
the armed millicents or rozz patrols weren't round there
much, being more north of the river these days
 We put our
maskies on - new jobs these were, real horrorshow, wonder-
fully done really; they were like faces of historical per-
sonalities (they gave you the names when you bought) and I
had Disraeli, Pete had Elvis Presley, Georgie had Henry VIII
and poor old Dim had a poet veck called Peebee Shelley; they
were a real like disguise, hair and all, and they were some very
special plastic veshch so you could roll it up when you'd done
with it and hide it in your boot - then three of us went in.
Pete keeping chasso without, not that there was anything to
worry about out there
 As soon as we launched on the shop
we went for Slouse who ran it, a big portwine jelly of a veck
who viddied at once what was coming and made straight for
the inside where the telephone was and perhaps his well-oiled
pooshka, complete with six dirty rounds
 We could tell she would creech
murder given one chance, so I was round that counter very
skorry and had a hold of her, and a horrorshow big lump she
was too, all nuking of scent and with flipflop big bobbing
groodies on her
 I'd got my rooker round her rot to stop her
belting out death and destruction to the four winds of
heaven, but this lady doggie gave me a large foul big bite on it
and it was me that did the creeching, and then she opened up
beautiful with a flip yell for the millicents
 Well, then she had
to be tolchocked proper with one of the weights for the
scales, and then a fair tap with a crowbar they had for opening
cases, and that brought the red out like an old friend
 So we
had her down on the floor and a rip of her platties for fun and
a gentle bit of the boot to stop her moaning
 And, viddying
her lying there with her groodies on show, I wondered should
I or not, but that was for later on in the evening
 His cravat
was like someone had trampled on it, his maskie had been
pulled off and he had floor-dirt on his litso, so we got him in
an alleyway and tidied him up a malenky bit, soaking our
tashtooks in spit to cheest the dirt off
 We were back in the Duke of New York very skorry
and I reckoned by my watch we hadn't been more than ten
minutes away
 The starry old baboochkas were still there on
the black and suds and Scotchmen we'd bought them, and we
said: "Hallo there, girlies, what's it going to be?"  They started
on the old "Very kind, lads, God bless you, boys," and so we
rang the collocol and brought a different waiter in this time
and we ordered beers with rum in, being sore athirst, my
brothers, and whatever the old ptitsas wanted
 Then I said to
the old baboochkas: "We haven't been out of here, have we?
Been here all the time, haven't we?"  They all caught on real
skorry and said:
"That's right, lads
 About half an hour went
by before there was any sign of life among the millicents, and
then it was only two very young rozzes that came in, very
pink under their big copper's shlemmies
 One said:
"You lot know anything about the happenings at Slouse's
shop this night?"
"Us?"  I said, innocent
 Two hospitalizations
 Where've
you lot been this evening?"
"I don't go for that nasty tone," I said
 "I don't care much
for these nasty insinuations
 Not seen them move we haven't."
"We're only asking," said the other young millicent
 "We've
got our job to do like anyone else."  But they gave us the nasty
warning look before they went out
